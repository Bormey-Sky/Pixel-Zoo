#  Mammals

### This location houses different type and breed of mammals 

Mammals are vertebrates with hair, mammary glands used to suckle young with milk, a diaphragm, three bones in the middle ear, and a lower jaw made up of a single pair of bones that articulates in a unique way with the skull.

Mammals are divided into **three groups - monotremes, marsupials and placentals,** all of which have fur, produce milk and are warm-blooded.

- **_Monotremes_** are the platypus and echidnas and the females lay soft-shelled eggs.

- **_Marsupials_** give birth to small, poorly developed young and most female marsupials, such as kangaroos, wallabies and the Koala, have pouches.

- **_Placental_** mammals, like humans, whales, rodents and bats, differ from monotremes and marsupials in that they generally give birth to well-developed young.

**but all mammals-**
- produce milk to feed their young
- have hair or fur
- have a unique jaw structure are warm-blooded
